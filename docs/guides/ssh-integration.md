# SSH Integration Guide

Interactive SSH access to cluster nodes directly from S9S for debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

## Overview

S9S provides direct SSH access to cluster nodes, allowing you to quickly open interactive terminal sessions for debugging jobs, inspecting node status, and performing administrative tasks.

**Features:**
- One-click interactive SSH to cluster nodes
- SSH connection testing and validation
- Node information retrieval via SSH
- Integration with job debugging workflows
- SSH terminal session management

## Quick SSH Access

### Basic SSH Operations

From the Nodes View, press `s` on a selected node to open an interactive SSH session.

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| `s` | SSH to selected node | Direct interactive SSH connection |
| `S` | SSH to selected node | Same as lowercase `s` |

### SSH from Different Views

**From Nodes View**:
```bash
# Navigate to nodes view
:view nodes

# Select a node and press 's' to open SSH session
node001  IDLE    16/32 cores  64GB/128GB  ← [s] SSH here
```

**From Jobs View**:
```bash
# Navigate to jobs view
:view jobs

# Press 's' on a running job to SSH to its allocated nodes
12345  alice  RUNNING  node[001-004]  ← [s] SSH to job nodes
```

## SSH Configuration

### Basic Configuration

S9S uses your system's SSH configuration by default. Configure SSH settings in `~/.s9s/config.yaml`:

```yaml
ssh:
  # Default SSH user
  defaultUser: ${USER}

  # SSH key file
  keyFile: ~/.ssh/id_rsa

  # Connection options
  compression: true
  forwardAgent: true
  connectTimeout: 10s

  # Additional SSH arguments
  extraArgs: "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=ask -o ServerAliveInterval=60"
```

### SSH Key Management

S9S leverages your existing SSH infrastructure:

```yaml
ssh:
  keys:
    # Default key
    default: ~/.ssh/id_rsa

  # Key agent settings
  agent:
    useAgent: true
    addKeysOnConnect: true
```

## Interactive SSH Sessions

### Single Node SSH

Connect to individual nodes for interactive work:

```bash
# Basic SSH connection
s  # Press 's' on selected node in Nodes View

# SSH session opens in your terminal, suspending s9s temporarily
user@node001:~$
```

When you exit the SSH session, S9S resumes automatically.

### SSH Terminal Manager

S9S provides an advanced SSH terminal manager for managing multiple SSH sessions:

```bash
# From nodes view, select a node
# Choose "SSH Terminal Manager" option

# Features:
# - View active SSH sessions
# - Switch between multiple node connections
# - Monitor session status
# - Quick access to node information
```

### SSH with Job Context

SSH directly to nodes running specific jobs:

```bash
# From jobs view, select a running job
12345  alice  RUNNING  node[001-004]  ← Select this

# Press 's' to SSH to the first node running this job
# Useful for debugging running jobs interactively
```

## SSH Features

### Connection Testing

Test SSH connectivity to a node before opening a session:

```bash
# From the SSH options menu, select "Test Connection"
# S9S will verify:
# - SSH connectivity
# - Authentication
# - Basic command execution
```

### Node Information Retrieval

Gather basic node information via SSH:

```bash
# From the SSH options menu, select "Get Node Info"
# Retrieves:
# - Hostname
# - Uptime
# - Memory usage
# - CPU count
# - Disk usage
```

### SSH Options Menu

When initiating SSH from the Nodes View, S9S presents options:

- **SSH Terminal Manager** - Advanced session management interface
- **Quick Connect** - Direct SSH connection (fastest)
- **Test Connection** - Verify SSH connectivity
- **Get Node Info** - Retrieve basic node information

## SSH Security

### Authentication Methods

S9S uses SSH key authentication by default:

```yaml
ssh:
  auth:
    method: key
    keyFile: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Security Best Practices

```yaml
ssh:
  security:
    # Require host key verification (recommended for production)
    strictHostKeyChecking: true
    knownHostsFile: ~/.ssh/known_hosts

    # Connection limits
    connectTimeout: 30s

    # Audit logging
    logConnections: true
    logFile: ~/.s9s/ssh.log
```

**Important Security Note**: By default, S9S disables strict host key checking for cluster environments where nodes are frequently rebuilt. For production use, enable strict host key checking in your configuration.

## SSH Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If SSH connection fails:

1. **Verify SSH connectivity manually**:
   ```bash
   ssh <nodename>
   ```

2. **Check SSH agent** (if using SSH agent):
   ```bash
   ssh-add -l
   ```

3. **Verify SSH key permissions**:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

4. **Check S9S SSH configuration**:
   ```yaml
   ssh:
     keyFile: ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Verify this path is correct
     defaultUser: ${USER}    # Verify username
   ```

### Common SSH Issues

**Problem**: "Permission denied (publickey)"
- **Solution**: Ensure your SSH public key is authorized on the target node
- Verify `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the node contains your public key

**Problem**: "Connection timeout"
- **Solution**: Check network connectivity to the node
- Verify the node is reachable: `ping <nodename>`

**Problem**: "Host key verification failed"
- **Solution**: Update known_hosts file
- Remove old key: `ssh-keygen -R <nodename>`
- Or disable strict host key checking (less secure)

## Best Practices

### SSH Usage

1. **Use SSH keys** - Never use password authentication
2. **Keep keys secure** - Protect private keys with file permissions (600)
3. **Use SSH agent** - Avoid entering passphrases repeatedly
4. **Close sessions** - Exit SSH sessions when done to free resources
5. **Verify node state** - Check node status before SSH (avoid DOWN or DRAIN nodes)

### Security

1. **Verify host keys** - Use strict host key checking in production
2. **Monitor connections** - Enable SSH connection logging
3. **Restrict access** - Ensure only authorized users have SSH access to nodes
4. **Audit regularly** - Review SSH logs for suspicious activity

## Workflow Examples

### Debug a Running Job

```bash
# 1. Navigate to jobs view
:view jobs

# 2. Find your running job
12345  alice  RUNNING  node[001-004]

# 3. Press 's' to SSH to a job node
# S9S suspends, SSH session opens

user@node001:~$ ps aux | grep <your_program>
user@node001:~$ htop -u alice
user@node001:~$ tail -f /path/to/job/output

# 4. Exit SSH session (Ctrl+D or 'exit')
# S9S resumes automatically
```

### Check Node Health

```bash
# 1. Navigate to nodes view
:view nodes

# 2. Select a problematic node
# 3. Press 's' → choose "Get Node Info"

# S9S retrieves and displays:
# - Uptime
# - Memory usage
# - Disk space
# - CPU count

# Or choose "Quick Connect" for full SSH access
```

### Investigate Failed Job

```bash
# 1. Find failed job in jobs view
12345  alice  FAILED  node003

# 2. Press 's' to SSH to the node where it failed
# 3. Investigate logs, check for errors

user@node003:~$ cd /scratch/alice/job_12345
user@node003:~$ less slurm-12345.out
user@node003:~$ dmesg | tail
```
